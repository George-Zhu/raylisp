FIXME

* Shaders are not currently affected by object transformations: since TRANSFORM
  belongs SCENE-OBJECT is seems better to deal with it outside user-provided
  functions. ...tricky, tricky...

* Shared CSG shaders.

* CSG differences showing the cuttee-surface (shader of cutter delegates
  somehow.)

* Test splitting of object in KD-tree construction for scenes where
  all objects overly other objects along the axes.

ARCHITECTURE

* Support for manual hierarchical bounding.

* Automatics hierarchical bounding for CSG

* Light buffers in SHADOW-FUNCTION.

* Rending protocol.

* Ray attenuation.

* Heterogenous media.

* Vista buffer. Saving a perfect vista buffer from previous rendering.

* Backwards raytracing.

* OpenGL preview.

* Computing functions to shade a given pixel. (Symbolic raytracing.)

* Real colors. (Wavelength based rendering.)

* Representing transformations with functions. (COMPILE to inline constants.)

COMPONENTS
