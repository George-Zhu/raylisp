* TODO FIXME
*** TODO Need RAY-MIN in addition to RAY-EXTENT
    Otherwise %FIND-INTERSECTION* can find intersections closer than
    it wants.
* TODO ARCHITECTURE
*** TODO Need to be able to transform textures independently from objects
*** TODO Shared CSG shaders
    It should be possible to specify a toplevel shader for an entire CGS.
*** TODO Named scene components (from master)
*** TODO CSG differences showing the cuttee-surface
    This is kind of nice the way it now works, actually, but it should
    be possible to tell the system to use the either to cuttee or the
    cutter. (Currently cutter is always used.)
*** TODO Manual bounding of objects
*** TODO Light buffers in SHADOW-FUNCTION
*** TODO CSG bounding
***** TODO Check if we currently currently bound CSG objects sensibly
      For intersections use intersection of bounding boxes, for
      differences use the bounding box of the cuttee.
***** TODO Automatic hierarchies
      Deeps CSG should benefit from this
*** TODO Antialiasing
*** TODO Translucent shadows
    Possibly just a shader?
*** TODO Support for manual hierarchical bounding
    Sometimes humans are better.
*** TODO Path tracing
*** TODO Multithreading
*** TODO Ray attenuation in transparent objects
    Simple homogenous mediums to start with.
*** TODO Volumetric rendering
*** TODO Vista buffer
    Projected bounding boxes to make fast decisions. At least those
    pixels where there is only a single object that can contribute
    are probably worth dealing with, no matter how good the KD tree
    is. Saving a perfect vista buffer from previous rendering might
    also be cool (this requires scenes to know when their geometry
    has changed, though.)
*** TODO Photon maps
*** TODO Backwards raytracing
    (Sampling the scene from light sources, collecting only those
    that hit the image plane.)
*** TODO OpenGL preview.
*** TODO Computing functions to shade a given pixel
    (Symbolic raytracing.)
*** TODO Real colors. (Wavelength based rendering.)

* TODO SCENE COMPONENTS
*** TODO Area lights
*** TODO Fake area lights
    AKA fake soft shadows, aka cheap soft shadows.
*** TODO Fake IOR
    Aka cheap caustics.
*** TODO Turbulence shader
*** TODO Marble shader
*** TODO Variant reflection
*** TODO Faked surface normals
*** TODO Light groups
    Lights illuminating only some objects
*** TODO Box
*** TODO Cylinder
*** TODO Torus
*** TODO Height fields
*** TODO Polygons
*** TODO Meshes
*** TODO Radiosity shader
*** TODO Metallic shaders
* TODO CAMERAS
*** TODO Orthogonal camera
*** TODO Fisheye camera
*** TODO Panorama camera
*** TODO Focal blur
* TODO MISCELLANY
*** Shearing transformations
    Nice constructor on SB-CGA needed.
